# School Exam Schedule

The program that calculates the passing status of the student according to the exam grades.



- While making this application, I started coding with imaginary exam grades and imaginary exam system. The project exam is a totally worthwhile exam and is exactly the equivalent of two exams.


- If the student cannot write more than 100 points here and tries to write, the system will give a warning.


- If the student's exam grade is 50 and above, he is considered to have passed the course and has no responsibility. If it is below 50 points, it cannot pass the course and is unsuccessful.
